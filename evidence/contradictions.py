    """
    Stub for contradiction detection.

    v0 rationale:
    - Reliable contradiction detection requires
      multi-paper comparison and semantic reasoning.
    - This is deferred until evidence signals
      and question extraction are stable.

    Output (v0):
    - Always returns empty list.
